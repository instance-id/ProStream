# Installation

Upon first importing the ProStream package, the ProStream Installer will appear. For optimal performance use the settings described in the [Recommended Project Settings](/getting-started/prerequisites#recommended-project-settings).

These settings can be automatically applied in the `Recommended Settings` window of the installer.

If an appropriate SRP (URP/HDRP) is installed, you can press the `Install ProStream` button to begin the installation.

## Why an Installer?

ProStream is designed to be installed as a package in order to ensure proper dependency installation and management and will not show up in your `Assets/` folder.

The purpose of the installer is to ensure that the package is installed to the correct location and that the necessary dependencies are installed.

::: tip
The installer can also be accessed by navigating to **Tools > instance.id > ProStream > (Install/Update) ProStream**
