**Advanced Unity Developer Tool for Scene Conversion and Streaming**

- Created a comprehensive developer tool that automates the conversion of traditional GameObject scenes to DOTS entity subscenes
- Developed a rule-based engine that intelligently analyzes scene structures and automatically creates optimized streaming layers
- Designed an intuitive editor interface that simplifies the complex process of setting up scene streaming with minimal manual configuration
- Built an automated system that handles GameObject-to-Entity conversion, subscene creation, and streaming setup through a guided workflow
- Implemented extensive documentation with step-by-step guides to help developers integrate advanced streaming capabilities into their projects

**Technical Highlights:**
- **Scene Automation & Processing:**
    - Created an intelligent scene analysis system that identifies optimal streaming boundaries based on object density and relationships
    - Built automatic layer generation that organizes GameObjects into logical streaming groups based on customizable rule sets
    - Implemented a GameObject-to-Entity conversion pipeline with automatic hierarchy preservation and reference maintenance
    - Developed a subscene creation system that handles all the complexity of breaking apart monolithic scenes into efficient streaming units

- **Performance Optimization Tools:**
    - Designed automated frustum culling integration using Unity's job system with Burst compilation for scenes processed by the tool
    - Created a configurable terrain LOD generation system that developers can customize based on their performance requirements
    - Implemented performance metrics tracking with Unity's ProfilerRecorder API to help developers optimize their converted scenes
    - Built bounds checking and occlusion systems that are automatically configured during the conversion process

- **Developer Experience:**
    - Crafted an intuitive Unity editor integration with wizard-style guidance for the conversion workflow
    - Built visual feedback systems showing streaming boundaries and performance impact analysis
    - Implemented serialized configuration settings allowing developers to save and reuse conversion parameters across projects
    - Created automated validation systems to ensure converted scenes will perform well in production

- **Diagnostics & Troubleshooting:**
    - Implemented a comprehensive diagnostic engine framework that helps developers identify and fix issues in their Unity projects
    - Created specialized diagnostic tools including mesh validation, shader compatibility checking, and DOTS compatibility validation
    - Built a unified UI with shortcut support (Alt+Shift+H) providing centralized access to all diagnostic tools
    - Designed the system with an extensible architecture allowing developers to create custom diagnostic tools
    - Developed intelligent issue detection with automated fix suggestions and one-click repair options
    - Incorporated asynchronous search capabilities using Unity's SearchService for performant project-wide scanning
    - Implemented robust error reporting with detailed contextual information for resolving conversion issues
